# Deepfake Detection Engine
A [web demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/csabhay/deep-fake-detection) is integrated to [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) Spaces with [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/).

In this Repository, we build a Deepfake Detection Engine using the facenet_pytorch Python library that provides implementations of deep learning models such as:
- MTCNN
> Used for face detection and alignment.

- InceptionResnetV1
> Used for detecting whether an image is fake or real.
